## Description

This website was created to showcase some of my projects for people to view.

---

## How to Install

This project does not require installation, just go to the website: https://runnerrupertportfolio.netlify.app/ 

---

## Usage

This website is mainly to showcase some of my work in a more professional way. You can learn about me on the initial tab, then see some of my projects within the portfolio tab. There is also a contact me form that currently has not been set up to recieve any actual communication. But, it is there for when it can. (This README will be updated when that happens). There is also a Resume tab where you can download (not-yet-implemented) my Resume and see some skills I have gained in programming.
